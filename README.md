# MM-Astroparticles

Code for Multi-Messengers and Astroparticle physics course to study the correlation between the XMax of an Extensive Air Shower and the Number of Muons that arrives at the station detectors.

The model used is an extension of the Heitler-Mathews model with more complex and advanced features.

The code is presented in such a way that updates on new particles or interactions are made easy for the user.

All initial conditions can be edited in the config file.

## Modes 

### 1. Normal  
    This mode calculates the evolution of particle showers from an initial to a final energy.

### 2. Monte Carlo
    This mode generates a uniform distribution of energies and calculates the evolution of showers.

### 3. Fixed Energy
    This mode starts with a fixed initial energy and calculates all showers with it.
